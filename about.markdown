# Gouravmoy Mohanty

Hello everyone. I am Gouravmoy Mohanty and I am a software engineer living in Bangalore India.  

# What and Why Eleanor?

I have created this blog to serve as a repository for all the knowledge I have and will be accumulating in my life. I am hoping to create posts about the topics I like like software engineering, books, photography, philosophy, short stories and life in general. I do this so that one day I and other may turn back to this for help and guidance 

I have named this blog for the female lead character of the same name in the book [Eleanor & Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_%26_Park). I had immensely enjoyed reading the book and had really like Eleanor's character in the book. So I have dedicated the  name of my blog in her name. 

# Software Engineering

I started my career working for a QA team. As I was the only one who had the knowledge of how to code, I was given over the responsibility to manage the automation tool for the project. It was fun working on a small independent project and improving an existing product.

After that I worked on creating an RCP (Rich Client Platform) based desktop application that will help QA team compare huge source and target datasets of any types (CSV, XML, database rows, etc.) and give them a report of the differences.

Next, in the current role, I have been working on building a web based application. It is an inhouse productivity suite consisting of multiple sub products. I have been working as a back-end developer in one of the sub-product
