I had recently visited [Bangalore Bannerghatta Zoo](https://goo.gl/maps/raG8JdDnprpZPSLy7). This is a zoo located in in the outskirts region of Bangalore city, Karnataka, India. This zoo is a part of a larger national wildlife park called Bannerghatta National Park ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bannerghatta_National_Park)).

For the past week I had been stuck in my house and had a yearn to go and spend some time with the Zoo animals. From time to time I feel the urge to slow down a bit and spend some time looking at the trees and nature. Living in a city, its often difficult to find such places. Places those are far away from the constant hubbub of the city.

The trip was a good 45 kilometers from my house but I enjoyed the bike ride (I have a Avenger Cruse 220cc bike). I had decided not to take my camera equipment for the visit as I had once on my previous trip taken a lot of pics and did not want to spend much of my time on clicking pics on this trip. I mostly wanted it to be a relaxed outing.

As I was on my own, I spend considerable amount roaming around the zoo. At times, I missed talking to other people as I usually go on such outings with my friends. But roaming alone also has its perks. You don't have to move around with a group all the time and take your own sweet time for everything.

Even though I had thought I will not take pics, but I was still drawn to taking few pics of the trees in the zoo. Many who photograph in the zoo mostly take pictures of the animals. But I like the trees. They are majestic and old. They are huge and make me feel small. I look at them in amazement at them every time. 

I wonder about the time it has taken the huge trees to grow. During this time, what all they would have seen and experienced. I know that these trees would have taken decades to grow. And in decades, they become so strong and resilient that no amount of wind or rain or any other calamity can uproot them.

In todays world where being fast and quick is everything and changes is always around the corner,  I am fascinated and feel awed by this slow process of trees growing from saplings to huge majestic trees. I feel,  like these trees, the work  or projects those we undertake in our life also needs time. When we spend time and energy nourishing these projects and give them time to grow, they will eventually become strong and resilient as a tree. We must have patience. Maybe that is why the saying goes - Patience is a virtue. 

Below are a few pictures which I took with my Samsung phone.

Finally, after the outing I went to a restaurant named [Fattoush](https://goo.gl/maps/KKBLL2V3Rkwgn5am6). This is one of the best places if you wnat to have authentic Arabian food.
