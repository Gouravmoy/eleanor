# Introduction

An step by step process to fry peanuts in my household. 

# Steps

1. Heat up the cookware. For this, even though a non stick cookware will be fine, but I will be using the recently acquired Tramontina Stainless steel pan.
2. Pre-heating is required as the pan is stainless steel. So heat it up on the induction cooker in the below rhythm:
   1. 5 mins at heat setting 400
   2. 10 mins at heat settings 600
   3. 1 min at heat setting 800 before bringing it back to 600
3. Start frying the raw peanuts. Keep stirring the peanuts, else it will get burned
4. It should take up to  10 mins for the cooking to be completed. Remember to keep stirring continuously else the peanuts will get burned
5. When you see that the outer layer of the peanuts are starting to break and the become a bit blackened, then the cooking is finished. Enjoy

# Observations

1. It may feel sometime more effort and time to pre-heat the pan than in actually making the peanuts. Power through it, the end result is good
2. Also, remember to always keep stirring
