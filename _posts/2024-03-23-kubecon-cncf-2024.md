# Kube Con 2024 Paris

I recently attended Kube Con 2024 held from 20th to 22nd March 2024 in France at the Paris Expo 1 Pl. de la Prte de Versailles, Paris. This was the first time I attended a conference and it was an excellent experience. More than 12,000 software engineers were in attendance.

Below are some of the sessions I had attended:

# Wed 20th Dec

**Key Note**

- Cool demo by Priyanka Sharma (Exec Director, CNF) on running a AI inference model on her local system. She ran a Kubernetes cluster in her local, deployed the LLM model and simple app. Took a picture of the crowd and the LLM model gave a brief description of the image
- In hindsight, not that cool, but this was the first time for me. It was a huge auditorium
- Almost all of the other keynotes were related to AI and ML. Some about the new developments in GPUs

**Architecting Resilience: Lessons from Managing 7K+ Kubernetes Clusters at Scale - Kwanghun Choi & Gyutae Bae, Kakao**

<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315"  src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WRACr5nXl9U?si=Q9pspaRWejoMS5N7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

- Presentation about the company does resiliency. The company - Kakao run many Kubernetes deployments and provide the service to multiple other client in South Korea
- The talked about how they managed when there was a big fire at one of their data centers
- The discussed the old architecture and the new architecture that was more resilient.
- Most of it< i could not understand as it dealt with platform engineering. But nevertheless, a good session>

**An Acronym Free Introduction to Software Supply Chain Security - Joshua Lock, Verizon**

<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1PKZGn0eoZE?si=QKKm-05oqX6g7pcp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

- This was a session that gave good introduction about Software supply chain
- The speaker provided where in each part of the supply chain vulnerabilities can be introduced by hackers
- The speaker also provided some real world case studies about such hacking attempts
- I liked the session. There was one example where the presenter mentioned `Software development should be like fast food`. Make all the the creative decisions at the menu (or the actual software). The delivery should be made as simple and boring as possible. 
- Keep things simple and secure in the delivery part. Don't make the delivery complicated

**Choose Your Own Adventure: The Struggle for Security - Whitney Lee, VMware & Viktor Farcic, Upbound**

<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sCyCmV0YrKw?si=Hg7IDr3c8Oa27Vsh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

- This was a fun session. Here the two presenters did a bit of gamification to secure an application deployed in Kubernetes
- They asked Sli.do questions to the audience as to what all technologies should be used to for each part of the security of the application
- The did the exercise with 4 points
   - Add Cluster Level policies
   - Implement runtime policies
   - Manage secrets
   - Secure pod to pod communication

**Cultural Shifts: Fostering a Chaos First Mindset in Platform Engineering - Sayan Mondal, Harness & Raj Vadheraju, FIS**

<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WUXFKxgZRsk?si=3bnLPpQSh08Ouasl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

- It was a presentation about how you can do Chaos testing for applications in production setup
- The presenter was interested in showcasing how we ca develop a Chaos mindset - the knowledge that things are going to to fail
- The main intention is to figure out if something fails, how does the application respond
- The presenter simulated chaos by using a CNCF project called Litmus. Using the project, the presenter created a test case where an pod of the application was intentionally brought down
- The application is connected to logs and observability is set up. These logs can later be verified about how the application performed when chaos was introduced

**How to Save Millions Over Years Using KEDA? - Solene Butruille, BlackRock**

<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PN-KT8ClISA?si=xtjVl3w3HtRo5jOe" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

- This was a session where I first saw the real time implementation of KEDA
- The presenter's company had a problem wherein containers those were spun up when a client initiated an active session kept consuming money and resources even thought the sessions were in-active
- They solved the problem by using KEDA. The wrote logic about how to consider a session as in-active in the KEDA config. Afterwards the presenter demonstrated how based on the logic, KEDA actually brought down the container that was used by an in-active session
- She mentioned that though this was good, they did not have much of savings as they had 3 year long term contracts with the Azure

After the sessions, we had KubeCrawl. This was a food and drinks party. I really liked it. After that my colleagues and I went back to have some more food and drinks at the local pub and then retired for the day
