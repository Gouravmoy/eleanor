# Background

I have been working for the past few years as a software engineer. I somehow had the luck on working on small independant products. I started my career working for a QA team. As i was the only one who had the knowledge of how to code, i was given over the responsibility to manage the automation tool for the project. 

After that I worked on creating an RCP (Rich Client Platform) based desktop application that will help QA team compare huge source and target datasets of any types (CSV, XML, database rows, etc) and give them a report of the differences.

Next, in the current role, I have been working on building a web based application. It is an inhouse productivity suite consisting of multiple sub products. I have been working as a back-end developer in one of the sub-product 

# Understanding the issues

In the past year and a half, i had been given an opertunity to start leading the product i was working on. I have been assigned the role of the Product Owner of the application. As we have a relatively small team for each of the products, many of the team members take up multiple roles.

Along with owing the product, i also started managing the scrumming in the project. Along with determing the direction of the product, i also started managing the day to day working of the project. 

While managing the scrumming of the project, i started to realize that there were a lot of processes missing in the project. Below are some of the problems i realized:

- There was no single process defined at the platform level for all the applications
- All products were working in silos without much co-ordination between themselves
- Even though it was said that the teams were working in agile teams, not many agile methodologies were followed except few like daily scrum meetings, sprint boards, task cards, etc. There was a lack of proper processes in place
- There was a lack of any kind of documentation in the team

# Agile: A revelation

After a few months of shadow-handling the project, i was given the full control of the project. Immediately, i started improving a few low hanging issues like 

- lack of documentation, lack of proper communication between the development and the quality team, adding few processes in place for proper communication between outside the product teams like Devops team, Database team, etc
